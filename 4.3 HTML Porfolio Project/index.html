    <h3>Aspiring Fullstack Developer</h3>
    <p><strong>I'm Danial Farhan</strong><br>
        An XR developer with nearly a decade of experience building immersive digital
        experiences that blur the line between virtual and reality. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong
        foundation in interactive design, real-time 3D development, and spatial computing.

        Now, I’m expanding my skill set and diving into fullstack development — blending my creative background with
        modern web technologies to build dynamic, scalable applications. I'm passionate about crafting user-centered
        solutions, whether in VR or on the web.<br>
